<h2>Yawnoc</h2>
<p class="subtitle">Unity</p>
Yawnoc is an experimental puzzle game I've developed based
on Conway's Game of Life. Green cells are collectible,
red cells are obstacles, white cells are living. The player's
objective is to collect every green cell by placing different
cells on the board and having them interact with each other.

One of the technical aspects of this prototype
that I enjoyed working on, is the fact that there are 
no sprites involved in the game. UI icons, board,
effects, are all shader code. I've tried to develop it 
without any text in the UI as a design challenge.

<h3>Rules and Ruleset</h3>

The board is actually developed with more rules
than the classic game, because it was important
for me to be able to implement different
rules and test them quickly.

Each rule is responsible for different cell type behaviors
or, if needed, macro behavior with multiple cells.

<br>
New rules can be specified implementing an abstract
class and the method <code>Apply(...)</code>.
<br>
<pre>
    <code class="language-cs">
        public abstract ECellType Apply(Board b, int x, int y);
    </code>
</pre>

<br>
A ruleset is then applied with:
<br>
<pre>
    <code class="language-cs">
        public void Apply(Conway.Board b)
        {
            b.ForEachCell(delegate (Board.ForEachCellParams p)
            {
                foreach (RuleBase r in Rules)
                {
                    b.ApplyRule(r, p.Position.x, p.Position.y);
                }
            });
        }
    </code>
</pre>

For example, Conway's rule is implemented as:

<pre>
    <code class="language-cs">
	[CreateAssetMenu(menuName="Conway/Rules/Conway", fileName="Conway")]
	public class RuleConway : RuleBase
	{
		public ECellType Alive;
		public ECellType Dead;

		public override ECellType Apply(Board b, int cx, int cy)
		{
			int liveNeighbors = 0;
			for (int ny = -1; ny <= 1; ny++)
			{
				for (int nx = -1; nx <= 1; nx++)
				{
					// Skip middle cell.
					if (nx == 0 && ny == 0) 
						continue;

					int x = (cx+nx); 
					int y = (cy+ny);

					// Skip cells outside the board.
					if (!b.IsInsideBoard(x,y))
						continue;

					int n = Convert.ToInt32(b.PreviousState.Get(x, y) == Alive);
					liveNeighbors += n;
				}
			}

			if (b.PreviousState.Get(cx, cy) == Alive) 
			{
				bool alive = (liveNeighbors >= 2 && liveNeighbors <= 3);
				return  alive ? Alive : Dead;
			} 
			else
			{
				bool alive = liveNeighbors == 3;
				return alive ? Alive : b.PreviousState.Get(cx, cy);
			}
		}
	}
    </code>
    
</pre>

<h3>
    The Game of Life as Procedural Art
</h3>

A small detail in the prototype is that, in the
background, cells are colored based on how many times
a live cell has been there, generating a heatmap that 
can be colored with an arbitrary gradient.
This results in several interesting patterns emerging 
from the board.

Not exactly worthy of a museum, but they're 
alright.
