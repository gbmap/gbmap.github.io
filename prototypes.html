            <h2>Catacumba</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Unity</p>

            Catacumba is a beat-em-up with RPG aspects that
            was developed in Unity with premade Assets. I implemented
            most of the mechanics, my favorite one being a basic 
            rule-based level generation algorithm with agents that
            dig corridors and rooms. Another interesting aspect of the 
            prototype is that the game uses a custom Rendering Pipeline 
            that I wrote.

        <h2>Yawnoc</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">Unity</p>
        Yawnoc is a puzzle game I've developed based
        on Conway's Game of Life. Green cells are collectible,
        red cells are obstacles, white cells are living.
        One of the technical aspects of this prototype
        that I enjoyed working on, is the fact that there are 
        no sprites involved in the game. UI icons, board,
        effects, are all shader code. 

        <br>

        <h3>Rules and Ruleset</h3>

        The board is actually developed with more rules
        than the classic game, because it was important
        for me to be able to implement different
        rules and test them quickly.

        <br>
        New rules can be specified implementing an abstract
        class and the method <code>Apply(...)</code>.
        <br>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-cs">
                public abstract ECellType Apply(Board b, int x, int y);
            </code>
        </pre>

        <br>
        A ruleset is then applied with:
        <br>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-cs">
                public void Apply(Conway.Board b)
                {
                    b.ForEachCell(delegate (Board.ForEachCellParams p)
                    {
                        foreach (RuleBase r in Rules)
                        {
                            b.ApplyRule(r, p.Position.x, p.Position.y);
                        }
                    });
                }
            </code>
        </pre>

        <h3>
            The Game of Life as Procedural Art
        </h3>

        A small detail in the prototype is that, in the
        background, cells are colored based on how many times
        a live cell has been there, generating a colored heatmap.
        This results in several interesting patterns emerging 
        from the board.

        <br>
        <table class="tbl_menu" >
            <tr>
                <img class="tbl_img" src="yawnoc-pattern1.png"/>
                <img class="tbl_img" src="yawnoc-pattern2.png"/>
                <img class="tbl_img" src="yawnoc-pattern3.png"/>
            </tr>    
        </table>

        Not exactly worthy of a museum, but they're 
        alright.

            Pogostick
        </h2>
        <p class="subtitle">Unity</p>

        This is a prototype I've made to test the surf mechanic
        present in the Counter-Strike games that borrow their
        movement behavior from old games. This game only allows
        you to use W and A as movement keys. The trailer is badly
        played because it was recorded with a touchpad.

            <h2>Space Cabr√≥n</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Unity</p>

            A shoot-em-up. Procedural beats and melodies played 
            by a broken synth I wrote. Player fires according
            to a beat. Enemies spawn according to another beat.
            Procedural music is hard.
