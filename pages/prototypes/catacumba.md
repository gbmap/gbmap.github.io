Catacumba is a beat-em-up with RPG aspects that
was developed in Unity with premade Assets. I implemented
most of the mechanics, my favorite one being a basic 
rule-based level generation algorithm with agents that
dig corridors and rooms. Another interesting aspect of the 
prototype is that the game uses a custom Rendering Pipeline 
that I wrote.
