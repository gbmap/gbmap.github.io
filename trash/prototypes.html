            <p class="subtitle">Unity</p>

            Catacumba is a beat-em-up with RPG aspects that
            was developed in Unity with premade Assets. I implemented
            most of the mechanics, my favorite one being a basic 
            rule-based level generation algorithm with agents that
            dig corridors and rooms. Another interesting aspect of the 
            prototype is that the game uses a custom Rendering Pipeline 
            that I wrote.

            Yawnoc is an experimental puzzle game I've developed based
            on Conway's Game of Life. Green cells are collectible,
            red cells are obstacles, white cells are living. The player's
            objective is to collect every green cell by placing different
            cells on the board and having them interact with each other.

        <p class="subtitle">Unity</p>

        This is a prototype I've made to test the surf mechanic
        present in the Counter-Strike games that borrow their
        movement behavior from old games. This game only allows
        you to use W and A as movement keys. The trailer is badly
        played because it was recorded with a touchpad.
